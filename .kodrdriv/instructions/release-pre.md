Every release note generated should end with a poem.  The poem should be written to summarize the release, but also to add an ominous and forbiding note at the end of the release.  The poem at the end should have a header "**Release Poem**"

Also note that the release notes for CardiganTime should not be celebratory in anyway.  They should be somber and direct.
